# Python Final Project: Pokemon Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data processing and analysis techniques using Python tools learned throughout the semester. The analysis focuses on examining Pokémon across Generations 1-6 and comparing their total base stats. The project incorporates data cleaning, merging, classes, and visualization.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly.express
- numpy
- jupyter (for local execution)

## Installation and Setup

### Local Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marconoriega0703-sys/MATH_120_Final_Project.git
   cd python_final_project
   ```

2. Install required packages (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```
4. Dataset
   ```bash
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon
   ```

### Google Colab Execution
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KdnYcrz-euXFmSH92iDFiBfQOhkOrbwu?authuser=1#scrollTo=WnLOytBFRqZt)
2. Upload the `notebook.ipynb` file or connect to your GitHub repository
3. Run the first cell to automatically set up the environment

## Usage
Run all cells in `notebook.ipynb` sequentially. The notebook will:
1. Set up the environment automatically
2. Load and clean the raw data
3. Perform statistical analysis
4. Generate visualizations
5. Save processed data to the `data/` folder
