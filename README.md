## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- jupyter (for local execution)

## Installation and Setup

### Local Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MBanuelos/math120_final_project.git
   cd python_final_project
   ```

2. Install required packages (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

### Google Colab Execution
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KdnYcrz-euXFmSH92iDFiBfQOhkOrbwu?authuser=1#scrollTo=WnLOytBFRqZt)
2. Upload the `notebook.ipynb` file or connect to your GitHub repository
3. Run the first cell to automatically set up the environment

## Data Description
- **Sales Data**: Contains transaction records with date, product, category, sales amount, region, and customer ID
- **Customer Data**: Contains customer information including name, age, email, and city

## Analysis Features
- Data loading and cleaning
- Data merging operations
- Summary statistics calculation
- Sales analysis by category and region
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Modular code organization

## Key Learning Objectives Demonstrated
- File I/O operations with pandas
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data merging and joining
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization
- Function creation and modular programming
- Environment compatibility (local vs. cloud)

## Usage
Run all cells in `notebook.ipynb` sequentially. The notebook will:
1. Set up the environment automatically
2. Load and clean the raw data
3. Perform statistical analysis
4. Generate visualizations
5. Save processed data to the `data/` folder
